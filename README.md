# Reversing-the-PS2-phat-ABS-case

I attempt to recreate the PS2 phat ABS case assembly, without the internal screw posts.

## Purpose

To put my skills in hardware design to the test, I decided to build a PC within the PlayStation 2's ABS shell. This spawned the need to recreate a practical version of the shall that I can use to approximate the design.

The case is composed of 4 parts in the SCPH-39003 model that I have used for this project:

**The base**
